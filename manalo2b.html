	<h1><strong><center><a name="top"></a>BTS' Speech at the UN General Assembly 2018</strong></h1></center>
	<p><u><b>Kim Namjoon speaking:</p></u></b>
	<p>Thank you, Mr. Secretary General, UNICEF Executive Director, Excellencies and distinguished guests from across the world.</p>
	<p>		My name is Kim Nam Jun, also known as RM, the leader of the group BTS. It’s an incredible honour to be invited to an occasion with such significance for today’s young generation.</p>
	<p>		Last November, BTS launched the “Love Myself” campaign with UNICEF, building on our belief that “true love first begins with loving myself.” 
		We have been partnering with UNICEF’s #ENDviolence program to protect children and young people all over the world from violence.
		Our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their action and enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world!</p>
	<p>		I would like to begin by talking about myself. 
		I was born in Ilsan, a city near Seoul, South Korea.  It’s a beautiful place, with a lake, hills, and even an annual flower festival. 
		I spent a happy childhood there, and I was just an ordinary boy. I would look up at the night sky in wonder and dream the dreams of a boy. 
		I used to imagine that I was a superhero, saving the world. In an intro to one of our early albums, there is a line that says, “My heart stopped…I was maybe nine or ten.” 
		Looking back, that’s when I began to worry about what other people thought of me and started seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the stars at night. I stopped daydreaming. 
		I tried to jam myself into moulds that other people made. Soon, I began to shut out my own voice and started to listen to the voices of others. 
		No one called out my name, and neither did I. My heart stopped and my eyes closed shut. So, like this, I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts. 
		I had one sanctuary, and that was music. There was a small voice in me that said, ‘Wake up, man, and listen to yourself!” But it took me a long time to hear music calling my name. 
		Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were hurdles. Most people thought we were hopeless. Sometimes, I just wanted to quit. 
		I think I was very lucky that I didn’t give it all up. I’m sure that I, and we, will keep stumbling and falling. We have become artists performing in huge stadiums and selling millions of albums. 
		But I am still an ordinary, twenty-four-year-old guy. If there’s anything that I’ve achieved, it was only possible because I had my other BTS members by my side, and because of the love and support of our ARMY fans. 
		Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. I am who I am today, with all my faults. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’s me, too. 
		These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I was, who I am, and who I hope to become.</p>
	<p>		I would like to say one last thing. After releasing the “Love Yourself” albums and launching the “Love Myself” campaign, we started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world, 
		how our message helped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves. These stories constantly remind us of our responsibility. So, let’s all take one more step. We have learned to love ourselves, 
		so now I urge you to “speak yourself. I would like to ask all of you. <b>What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat? Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. 
		No matter who you are, where you’re from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself. Find your name, find your voice by speaking yourself.</b></p>
	<p>		I’m Kim Namjoon, RM of BTS. I’m a hip-hop idol and an artist from a small town in Korea. Like most people, I made many mistakes in my life. I have many faults and I have many fears, 
	but I am going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself, little by little. <b>What is your name? Speak Yourself!</b></p>

	<h1><strong><center><a name="top_2"></a>BTS' Speech at the UN General Assembly 2020</strong></h1></center>
	<p><b>RM:</b> Thank you, representatives of the members states of Group of Friends of Solidarity for Global Health Security, UNICEF Executive Director, Excellencies, and distinguished guests from all around the world. It is a great honor for us to have this valuable opportunity to speak in a session in the 75th UN General Assembly.</p>
	<p>My name is RM, the leader of the group BTS. Two years ago, here, I asked your name. I urged you to let me hear your voice and I let myself be filled with imagination. As a boy from the small city of Ilsan in Korea, as a young man standing at the UNGA, as a global citizen of this world, I imagined the limitless possibilities before all of us and my heart beating with excitement. 
		But COVID-19 was beyond my imagination. Our world tour was totally cancelled, all of our plans went away, and I became alone. I looked up but couldn’t see the stars at night.</p>
	<p><b>Jimin:</b> I felt hopeless. Everything fell apart. I could only look outside my window, I could only go to my room. Yesterday, I was singing and dancing with fans around the world, and now my world had shrunk to a room. And then, my friends took my hand. We comforted each other and talked about what we could do together.</p>
	<p><b>Suga:</b> Life became simple, maybe for the first time. It was precious time, unwanted but welcome. I’m used to an entire world shrinking in an instant. When I’m on tour, I stand in bright lights and loud cheers, but at night in my room, my world becomes only a few paces wide. The room itself was small, but my world and our world, reached far and wide. In this world we had our instruments, our phones and our fans.</p>
	<p><b>V:</b> But this time it felt different. It felt lonelier and smaller. “Why?” I thought for a long time. I thought, maybe because it became harder to imagine. I was frustrated and depressed, but I took notes, wrote songs, and thought about who I was. I thought, “If I give up here, then I’m not the star of my life. This is what an awesome person would do.”</p>
	<p><b>J-hope:</b> I don’t know who was first. We embraced all these emotions and the seven of us began to make music together. This is where the music came from and this made us honest. Our lives are unpredictable. We don’t know all the answers. I knew where I wanted to go, but not how I could get there. All I did to get here was trust ourselves, do my best and love what I do.</p>
	<p><b>Jin:</b> I found again the people I love. The other members. my family, my friends. I found the music I love, and I found myself. Thinking about the future and trying hard are all important. But cherishing yourself, encouraging yourself and keeping yourself happy is the most important. In a world of uncertainty, we must cherish the importance of “me,” “you,” and “us.”
		That’s the message of “Love Myself” we talked about for three years, it’s the message in the lyrics of our song “Dynamite” — “I’m diamond, you know I glow up.”</p>
	<p><b>Jung Kook:</b> One night we were working together. RM said he couldn’t see the stars anymore, but I saw my face reflected in the window. I saw all of our faces. Our songs became the stories we wanted to tell each other. We live in uncertainty, but really, nothing’s changed. If there’s something I can do, if our voices can give strength to people, then that’s what we want and that’s what we’ll keep on doing.</p>
	<p><b>RM:</b> When I start feeling lost, I remember my face in the window. Like Jungkook said. I remember the words I spoke here two years ago: “Love yourself, speak yourself.”</p>
	<p>Now more than ever, we must try to remember who we are and face who we are. We must try to love ourselves, and imagine the future. BTS will be there with you.</p>
	<p>Our tomorrow may be dark, painful, difficult. We might stumble or fall down. Stars shine brightest when the night is darkest. If the stars are hidden, we’ll let moonlight guide us. If even the moon is fark, let our faces be the light that helps us find our way.</p>
	<p>Let’s reimagine our world. We’re huddled together tired, but let’s dream again. Let’s dream about a future when our worlds can break out of our small rooms again. It might feel like it’s night and we’ll always be alone, but the night is always the darkest before the first light of dawn.</p>
	<p><b>BTS: Life goes on. Let’s live on.</b></p>

	<h1><strong><center><a name="top_3"></a>BTS' Speech at the UN General Assembly 2021</strong></h1></center>
	<p><b>RM:</b> Your Excellency, Abdulla Shahid, President of the 76th United Nations General Assembly, Your Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Your Excellency President Moon Jae-In and distinguished leaders from around the world, it is an honor to be here today. We’re BTS, appointed as special presidential envoys of the Republic of Korea. We’re here today to share the stories of our future generation.
			Before we came here we asked the young people in their teens and twenties around the world about their past two years and about the world they find themselves in today. Jin will share some of the answers we received.</p>

	<p><b>Jin:</b> Yes, should we take a look? You can feel the good vibes from just looking at these. There were times during the past two years when I too felt bewildered and troubled but still here we have people who cry out, “Let’s live on. Let’s make the best of this moment.”</p>

	<p><b>Jimin:</b> Because we can’t stand still when we are in the ideal time of our lives to take on new challenges. It wasn’t as if we could blame anyone and you must have felt the frustration.</p>

	<p><b>Jungkook:</b> Here I’m the same as I was yesterday, but the world changed. Like we were transported in a flash to a parallel world. I was saddened to hear that entrance and graduation ceremonies had to be canceled. These are moments in life you want to celebrate. And missing out on them must have been upsetting. We were heartbroken when our long-planned concert tours were cancelled, and for a while we yearned for the moments we wanted to make complete.</p>

	<p><b>Suga:</b> Yes, it was a time for us to mourn for the things that Covid took away from us. A time to discover how precious each and every moment we’d taken for granted were.</p>

	<p><b>Jimin:</b> Suga mentioned that precious things were taken for granted. And lots of people answered our question by sharing pictures of their precious moments. Many people showed how they share their moments with nature. I think during these two years they found dear the time they experienced and care for nature.</p>

	<p><b>J-Hope:</b> Yes, but maybe because we feel an encroaching sense of dread that our time on this earth is limited. We just talk about the things we mourn, and I shudder to think about mourning for the earth. Everyone agrees that climate change is an important problem, but talking about what the best solution might be… That’s not easy. It’s a topic that’s tough to make conclusions about.</p>

	<p><b>RM:</b> Yes, it is a tough discussion. But I learned while preparing for today that there are many young people who have an interest in environmental issues and choose it as their field of study. The future is unexplored territory. And that’s where we more than anyone will spend our time.</p>

	<p><b>V:</b> So these young people were searching for the answers to the question of how we must live that future. So I hope we don’t just consider the future as grim darkness. We have people who are concerned for the world and searching for the answers. There are still many pages left in this story about us, and I thought we shouldn’t talk like the ending’s already been written.</p>

	<p><b>Jungkook:</b> Of course, sometimes the world seems stuck in place even if you’re ready to go. Sometimes it feels like you’ve lost your way. There was a time when we felt the same way.</p>

	<p><b>RM:</b> I’ve heard that people in their teens and twenties today are being referred to as Covid’s lost generation. That they’ve lost their way at a time when they need the most diverse opportunities. They must try new things. But I think it’s a stretch to say they’re lost just because the paths they tread can by seen by grown-up eyes.</p>

	<p><b>Jimin:</b> Yes, take a look at these pictures. Here we have many who are trying hard to continue their friendships online in new ways. Start learning new things, live healthier lives. I’m sorry, excuse me. Yes, these kids are trying to learn new things and trying to figure new things out. They don’t look lost.</p>

	<p><b>Jin:</b> They look like they are finding new courage and taking on new challenges. I think that’s why instead of the lost generation a more appropriate name would be the welcome generation. Because instead of fearing change, this generation says welcome and keeps forging ahead.</p>

	<p><b>RM:</b> That’s right. If we believe in possibilities and hope, even when the unexpected happens we will not lose our way but discover new ones.</p>

	<p><b>Suga:</b> There will be choices we make that may not be perfect. But that does not mean there will be nothing we can do. That’s what I think.</p>

	<p><b>J-Hope:</b> What is important are the choices we make when we’re faced with change. Right? Some of you heard the news that we’re coming to the UN, and a lot of you were wondering whether we have been vaccinated.</p>
	
	<p><b>RM:</b> I’ll take this opportunity to say yes. All seven of us. Of course we received vaccinations. The vaccination was a sort of ticket to meeting our fans waiting for us. And to being able to stand here before you today. Just like we said in our message today, we too are doing the things that we’re able to do right now.</p>

	<p><b>V:</b> Like the vaccinations. Efforts are continuously underway to keep this new reality going forward. I think the day we can meet again face to face is not far away. Until then I hope we can fill each of our days to the brim with positive energy.</p>

	<p><b>RM:</b> We thought the world has stopped, but it continues to move forward. I believe that every choice we make is the beginning of change, not the end. I hope that in this nascent new world we can all say to each other, "Welcome." And now, as we look forward to this future, the permission to dance is our message of welcome that we want to share with everyone today.</p>
